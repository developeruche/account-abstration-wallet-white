# Abstract Acccount Wallet White paper 

The goal of the whitepaper is to implement account abstraction without passing through Metamask. I feel there is no much difference to the user is the to have there mastmask address and private key to protect and also the address of their contract account, where if the private of the metamask wallet is compromised the comtract account is subject to accacks also. 

This can be sold be changing the validation scheme used by the contract wallet to one which is not ECDSA and is qunatum resitant.
